# Questions to be clarified

* What are the key legal considerations we need to keep in mind with respect to open source code? For example:
  * What are the legal obligations obligations that would prevent the disclosure of open source code?
  * Is source code subject to ATIP requests?
    * Is source code considered a “document/record” for the law?
    * What are the exclusions that would apply?
  * Can contracted professional services be used to contribute to third-party projects?
  * When choosing a licence, what are the constraints and key considerations (patents?)?
  * Can we provide financial support for foundations and initiatives? (*Can we do this? Why not? Need formal clarification*)
* What are some of the key IP considerations when dealing with Open Source Code?
  * If vendors hold IP, how can we ensure that the GC can provide explainability of system functionality and how outcomes were reached? (i.e. automated decisions?)
  * What patents apply for software developed by the Government of Canada? For example, could it be considered an “Invention”, etc?
  * When contributing to a third-party, some projects require contributors to transfer intellectual property of their work. Can a GoC employee transfer IP of work done as part of their job to third-party project? Contributors Licencing Agreement (IP transfers)
  * Can employees of the Government of Canada  contribute code to projects that do not request intellectual property transfer.
* Specific use cases:
  * When forking a 3rd party open source project, how do I manage Intellectual Property (Copyrights) and Licences:
    * Exemple would be a project that has added a CC on their licence like MIT. Do I keep the CC there, add Crown Copyright for our version? Can I/Should I change the licence? If so, when am I allowed to do so? What are the constraints?
