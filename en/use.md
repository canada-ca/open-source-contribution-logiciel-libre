# Government of Canada Standard on the Use of Third Party Open Source Software (DRAFT)

> Notice: The Standard format has been used to help drive the discussion around the requirements to open source code and support open source projects. The content of this document may reside elsewhere than in a Standard. As such, not all sections of a Standard will be kept at this time.

## Scope

These requirements apply to:

* All Open Source Software developed and maintained by a Third Party:
  * used by Government of Canada employees to perform their duties internally.
  * used within solutions developed by and for the Government of Canada for internal and external use.

A list of exclusions is attached in the [Exceptions](#exceptions) section.

## Objectives

* Set the standards and best practices for using open source software for internal and external purposes.
* Encourage the use open source software for internal use by Government of Canada employees or for the development of solutions to Canadian citizens.
* Improving the overall availability of re-usable technology within government and society.
* Support and increase collaboration with other public administrations in Canada and around the world.

## Expected results

* Increase the number of Government of Canada projects using third party open source software.
* Ensure legal compliance.
* Increase security and resiliance of the overall IT environment.

## Requirements

### A. Licence Compliance

* Use must be compliant with the Third Party licence applied to Open Source Software
* Must scan internally developed solutions for licence compliance

### B. Re-use

* Third Party Open Source Software assessed once should be made available to the Government as a whole.
  * Assessments should be made available to Government as a whole.

## Exceptions

*To be defined*
Examples:

* Code being tested and is disposable, not bringing value to Government or Canadians.
* Software deemed of National security value.
* Explaining and documenting why a project is not released if it has been deemed not having a benefit to Canadians.

## Definitions

### Approved Licence

You should publish your code under an [Open Source Initiative approved licence](https://opensource.org/licenses).

When contributing to external open source software, the choice of the licence must comply with the existing licence of the project. Where a reciprocal licence obligation is in force, you need to license your code under the same licence. As well, even if you are not under a strict legal obligation to apply a particular licence, you may still wish to adopt the same licence as an existing software project or community in order to become involved with it.

Where you distribute a project consisting entirely of your own code, or consisting of your own code along with permissively-licenced code and code which does not engage reciprocal obligations, you can choose the open source software licence yourself. The licence you choose should reflect your business requirements. All common open source software licences can be adopted for works by government, industry, or the education sector - you need to look at particular project aims.

Choosing an appropriate licence tends to revolve around the decision of whether to apply a reciprocal or permissive licence:

* Permissive licences maximize the scope of downstream users (with broad appeal to the entire private sector); while
* Reciprocal licences are appropriate in cases where it is important to receive back downstream changes, or where it is important to ensure that work built on an initial investment remains open and free. Reciprocal licences can also put a focus on benefiting other private-sector businesses that provide services and support.

### Intellectual Property

Crown copyright act implications... All code produced by civil servants is automatically covered by Crown Copyright. (See questions to be clarified)

### Protected Information

The Treasury Board [Directive on Departmental Security Management (DDSM)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579) defines protected information as one that "may qualify for an exemption or exclusion under the Access to Information Act or the Privacy Act because its disclosure would reasonably be expected to compromise the non-national interest."

### Source Code

Source code is code written in a human readable language for software projects, modules, plugins, scripts, middleware, and APIs; it does not, however, include code documentation.

### Source Code Repository

Examples of open Internet source code repositories, include, but are not limited to:

* Gitlab
* Github
* Bitbucket
* Framagit
* SourceForge
