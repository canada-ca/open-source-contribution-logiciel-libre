# Government of Canada Standard on Contribution to Third Party Open Source Software (DRAFT)

> Notice: The Standard format has been used to help drive the discussion around the requirements to open source code and support open source projects. The content of this document may reside elsewhere than in a Standard. As such, not all sections of a Standard will be kept at this time.

## Scope

These requirements apply to:

* All Open Source Software used by the Government of Canada.

A list of exclusions is attached in the [Exceptions](#exceptions) section.

## Objectives

* Set the standards and best practices for contributing to Third Party Open Source Software projects.
* Support and be an active contributor to Third Party Open Source Software used by the Government of Canada and/or where there is benefit to Canadians.
* Improving the overall availability of re-usable technology within government and society.
* Support and increase collaboration with other public administrations in Canada and around the world.

## Expected results

* Increase the number of Government of Canada contributions to third party open source software.

## Requirements

### Contribute to third-party open source software projects used by the Government of Canada and/or where there is benefit to the Government and Canadians

* Third-party open source software used by Government of Canada must be registered in the [Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/open-source-software.html).
* Code contributions must be done in accordance to Crown Copyright Law constraints.
* Issues, bugs and feature requests should be identified to the third party project through their issue tracking system.

### Identification of Security Vulnerabilities & Involuntary Disclosure

* See Cyber policy

## Exceptions

*To be defined*
Examples:

* Code contributions to projects requiring IP transfer.

## Definitions

### Approved Licence

When contributing to external open source software, the choice of the licence must comply with the existing licence of the project. Where a reciprocal licence obligation is in force, you need to license your code under the same licence. As well, even if you are not under a strict legal obligation to apply a particular licence, you may still wish to adopt the same licence as an existing software project or community in order to become involved with it.

[Choosealicence.com](https://choosealicense.com/) simplifies the process of selecting an open source software licence by presenting definitions of the most widely used licenses.

### Intellectual Property

Crown copyright act implications... All code produced by civil servants is automatically covered by Crown Copyright. (See questions to be clarified)

### Protected Information

The Treasury Board [Directive on Departmental Security Management (DDSM)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=16579) defines protected information as one that "may qualify for an exemption or exclusion under the Access to Information Act or the Privacy Act because its disclosure would reasonably be expected to compromise the non-national interest."

### Contributions

## Questions to be clarified

* What are the key legal considerations we need to keep in mind with respect to open source code? For example:
  * What are the legal obligations obligations that would prevent the disclosure of open source code?
  * Is source code subject to ATIP requests?
    * Is source code considered a “document/record” for the law?
    * What are the exclusions that would apply?
  * Can contracted professional services be used to contribute to third-party projects?
  * When choosing a licence, what are the constraints and key considerations (patents?)?
  * Can we provide financial support for foundations and initiatives? (*Can we do this? Why not? Need formal clarification*)
* What are some of the key IP considerations when dealing with Open Source Code?
  * If vendors hold IP, how can we ensure that the GC can provide explainability of system functionality and how outcomes were reached? (i.e. automated decisions?)
  * What patents apply for software developed by the Government of Canada? For example, could it be considered an “Invention”, etc?
  * When contributing to a third-party, some projects require contributors to transfer intellectual property of their work. Can a GoC employee transfer IP of work done as part of their job to third-party project? Contributors Licencing Agreement (IP transfers)
  * Can employees of the Government of Canada  contribute code to projects that do not request intellectual property transfer.
* Specific use cases:
  * When forking a 3rd party open source project, how do I manage Intellectual Property (Copyrights) and Licences:
    * Exemple would be a project that has added a CC on their licence like MIT. Do I keep the CC there, add Crown Copyright for our version? Can I/Should I change the licence? If so, when am I allowed to do so? What are the constraints?
